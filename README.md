# Linux Medication Manager TUI
The Medication Manager TUI is a bash TUI I made for myself and others with similar situations to not only track our medications, appointments, and mood, but to do so in a sleek, stylish terminal app (you know how us Linux users can be!)

# Dependencies and Installation
## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run Linux Medication Manager TUI (see repos for installation instructions):
[Gum - A tool for glamorous shell scripts](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum)

## Installation
Installing is as simple as cloning the repo and running the./medMang.sh. Doing so will create a ```~/.config/medMang``` directory where the config CAN be editied, but it really does not NEED to be.

```sh
    git clone https://github.com/jaredreyes039/Med-Manager-TUI
    cd ./Med-Manager-TUI
    ./medMang.sh
```
